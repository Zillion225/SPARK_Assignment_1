Question:
Please write a query to display product id ,product name ,customer full name , customer
citizen who have customer_id = '001110001'

Answer:
SELECT 
    p.product_id, 
    p.product_name, 
    c.full_name, 
    c.citizen
FROM Customers c
JOIN Orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
JOIN Products p ON o.product_id = p.product_id
WHERE c.customer_id = '001110001'

Explanation:
1. Order: The Orders table functions as an intermediary. In typical system architectures, customers do not simply own products because the relationship is instead defined by the transaction of ordering them.

2. JOIN Orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id: Find all order records that belong to that specific customer. Now the database knows which orders were made, but it only sees product IDs (numbers), not names.

3. JOIN Products p ON o.product_id = p.product_id: Use the product IDs found in the orders to look up the actual names in the Products table.
