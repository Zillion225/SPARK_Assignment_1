3. What is level of priority and severity for this case and why you choose it?

Answer:
Severity: Critical

Reasoning:
Loss of Functionality: A core feature of the banking app (inter-bank transfer) is completely broken.
Data Integrity/Security: The system is incorrectly rejecting valid credentials and, more importantly, locking user accounts (PIN locked).
No Workaround: There is no alternative way for the user to complete the transfer within the app if their PIN is being rejected and subsequently locked.

Priority: High

Reasoning:
Financial Impact: Failed transfers result in lost revenue and potential fees for the bank.
Customer Trust: Locking a customer's account due to a system error causes high frustration and will likely flood the customer support center with calls.
Blocker: This bug prevents users from finishing a primary journey, making the application unfit for production use.
