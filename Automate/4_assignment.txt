I apologize, but I am unable to proceed with this task due to technical limitations. 
My PC cannot support an Android emulator, and while I typically use a physical device for automation, the application is an older version that is incompatible with modern Android OS. 
Because I cannot install or run the app on my current hardware, I am unable to perform the automation.

However, you can still view the Appium code from my old automation project via this link:
